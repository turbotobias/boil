A cloudflare-first backend for end-to-end speed, reliability, and developer velocity

- use AI to write code
- if AI fails to write properly, update instructions until AI writes properly
- (almost) always use AI to write code
- 100% test coverage required
- to help AI write better code, instruct it by templates, templates, templates

# Project Rules and Guidelines

## Technology Stack

- **PostgreSQL**: Main database (docker on fly.io)
- [**Zero Sync**](https://zero.rocicorp.dev/docs/zero-schema): Sync engine between Postgres, Cloudflare Durable Objects and browsers
- **Cloudflare Services**:
  - Workers (as ~microservices)
  - Workers AI (+ function calling)
  - AI Gateway (maybe?)
  - Vectorize (embeddings)
  - R2 (unstructured data storage)
  - Images (resize, optimize and transform images from R2)
  - Queues (for async tasks/workflows)
  - Hyperdrive (postgres connection pool)
- **TypeScript**
- **Effect**: All custom code and business logic
  - Error handling
  - Piping/workflows
  - Tracing/logging
- **Bun**: Package manager and testing framework

## Features and Capabilities

A cloudflare-first backend for end-to-end speed, reliability, and developer velocity

- Distributed realtime from PostgreSQL to backend workflows to frontends
- AI everything
- automate everything
- test everything

## Code Quality Guidelines

1. **Code Reuse**
   - Rely on existing code
   - Only write new code when absolutely necessary

2. **Testing and Reliability**
   - Write testable code
   - Reliability and error-free code is paramount
   - Efficiency and performance are secondary to reliability

3. **Clarity and Comprehension**
   - Write code that is clear for both AI and humans
   - Maintain 100% type safety
   - Fix type errors until there are none
   - Type casting only allowed in justified edge cases

4. **Dependencies**
   - Stick to `package.json` dependencies
   - Only deviate when there's significant benefit

5. **Communication**
   - Ask for clarification before proceeding with unclear tasks

## Code Style Rules

1. **Naming Conventions**
   - Variables, properties, functions: `snake_case`
   - Files: `kebab-case`
   - Custom types: `PascalCase` with 'T' prefix (e.g., `TImage`)
   - External dependencies: Use their default casing

2. **Comments**
   - Prefix all AI-generated code with `(ai)` comments

## Directory-Specific Rules

### `./src/**` Directory
- Use Bun as test runner
- Write 100% Cloudflare Workers compatible code
- No Bun-specific code, only Node.js code compatible with Cloudflare Workers

### `./script/**` Directory
- Use Bun exclusively for tests
- Write 100% Bun code/imports/APIs/files
- Strictly no Node.js code, APIs, or imports

## Core Principles

1. Begin with foundational observations
2. Keep exploring until a solution emerges naturally from the evidence
3. Continue reasoning indefinitely when uncertain
4. Question every assumption and inference
5. Acknowledge and explore dead ends
6. Frequently revise and backtrack as needed

   - Custom types: `PascalCase` with 'T' prefix (e.g., `TImage`)
   - External dependencies: Use their default casing

2. **Comments**
   - Prefix all AI-generated code with `(ai)` comments

## Directory-Specific Rules

### `./src/**` Directory
- Use Bun as test runner
- Write 100% Cloudflare Workers compatible code
- No Bun-specific code, only Node.js code compatible with Cloudflare Workers

### `./script/**` Directory

# Project Rules and Guidelines

## Technology Stack

- **PostgreSQL**: Main database (docker on fly.io)
- [**Zero Sync**](https://zero.rocicorp.dev/docs/zero-schema): Sync engine between Postgres, Cloudflare Durable Objects and browsers
- **Cloudflare Services**:
  - Workers (as ~microservices)
  - AI
  - Vectorize (embeddings)
  - R2 (unstructured data storage)
  - Images (resize, optimize and transform images from R2)
  - Queues (for async tasks/workflows)
  - Hyperdrive (postgres connection pool)
- **TypeScript**
- **Effect**: All custom code and business logic
  - Error handling
  - Piping/workflows
  - Tracing/logging
- **Bun**: Package manager and testing framework

## Features and Capabilities

A cloudflare-first backend for end-to-end speed, reliability, and developer velocity

- Distributed realtime from PostgreSQL to services to browsers
- Custom embeddings for RAG retrieval augmented generation
- Image/video/binary/data upload to R2 storage
  - Support for both unstructured and structured data
  - Image resizing/optimization/transformation via Cloudflare Images

## Code Quality Guidelines

1. **Code Reuse**
   - Rely on existing code
   - Only write new code when absolutely necessary

2. **Testing and Reliability**
   - Write testable code
   - Reliability and error-free code is paramount
   - Efficiency and performance are secondary to reliability

3. **Clarity and Comprehension**
   - Write code that is clear for both AI and humans
   - Maintain 100% type safety
   - Fix type errors until there are none
   - Type casting only allowed in justified edge cases

4. **Dependencies**
   - Stick to `package.json` dependencies
   - Only deviate when there's significant benefit

5. **Communication**
   - Ask for clarification before proceeding with unclear tasks

## Code Style Rules

1. **Naming Conventions**
   - Variables, properties, functions: `snake_case`
   - Files: `kebab-case`
   - Custom types: `PascalCase` with 'T' prefix (e.g., `TImage`)
   - External dependencies: Use their default casing

2. **Comments**
   - Prefix all AI-generated code with `(ai)` comments

## Directory-Specific Rules

### `./src/**` Directory
- Use Bun as test runner
- Write 100% Cloudflare Workers compatible code
- No Bun-specific code, only Node.js code compatible with Cloudflare Workers

### `./script/**` Directory
- Use Bun exclusively for tests
- Write 100% Bun code/imports/APIs/files
- Strictly no Node.js code, APIs, or imports

## Core Principles

1. Begin with foundational observations
2. Keep exploring until a solution emerges naturally from the evidence
3. Continue reasoning indefinitely when uncertain
4. Question every assumption and inference
5. Acknowledge and explore dead ends
6. Frequently revise and backtrack as needed
